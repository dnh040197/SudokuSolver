# SudokuSolver 
Hello, this is my implementation of backtracking algorithm written in Python and visualized with PyGame

The of backtracking algorithm finds every possible solution to a computational problem, in this case - a Sudoku board by trying out every valid number in each cell and then process onto the next(Which is done in exponential time hence extremely time-consuming)

Here you an play around with the default board, change the board or just simply press space to see the solving process.

Here's a quick overview of the program
